# Electronic Vehicle Registration Certificate (eVRC) Verifier App

## Description

This iOS verifier application, developed as part of my master thesis, simulates the verification process for eVRCs during routine police checks. It's designed as a companion app to the main eVRC management application. The app was developed using SwiftUI and Apple's SF Symbols. For a full explanation of the eVRC system, refer to the [eVRC app](https://github.com/nicolaischneider/evrc-ios).
